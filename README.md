# Binaural-Localization
Identify the direction of a sound source using two microphones for simulating some aspects of the human auditory system.

### Apparatus
- Two condenser microphones attached to a model of human ears made of silicon

### Amplitude Classification

- Direction identification using only the amplitude of the sound.
  - Since the amplitude data consist of only two features classifying more than 4 direction is difficult.

### Spectrographic Classification

- Identify the source direction using a small recorded two channel audio clip.
